# JSMEA Codebook, Standard ID and Data Catalog used in ISO19848

Codebook, Standard ID and Data Catalog used in ISO19848 proposed by [JSMEA](https://www.jsmea.or.jp/index_en.html) and [SSAP](http://www.jsmea.or.jp/ssap/) are published.


## Overview of SSAP
[Japan Ship Machinery and Equipment Association (JSMEA)](https://www.jsmea.or.jp/index_en.html) has been proceeding with technological development, running the [Ship Smart Application Platform (SSAP)](http://www.jsmea.or.jp/ssap/) under its umbrella from 2012. The SSAP consists of JSMEA members; shipping, shipbuilding and ICT companies; and a classification society.

## Ship IoT Data Naming Framework
- IoT data (sensor data) is very important & essential work for utilizing data for AI and Big data. However, it requires a lot of effort to define naming scheme, dictionary and standard names.
- ISO 19848 Annex B & C provide scheme for Standard Codebook and Standard ID.
- Standard data catalogue, which consists of Standard IDs, can be defined in correspondence with service category.

## Standard Data Catalog

Data Catalogue contains the list of required sensor data, least sampling interval and data kind (inst, average, etc.) for each service category.

## Acknowledgment

This activity of JSMEA is cooperated with the Japan Ship Technology Research Association (JSTRA), which is supported by the Nippon Foundation.
